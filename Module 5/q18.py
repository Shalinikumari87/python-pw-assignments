question: In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries.
Answer: In following situtation lists preferred over dictionaries:
        Lists preserve the order of elements and allow us to access items by their index
         (position). This makes lists ideal when the order of elements matters.

        Lists are ideal when  a collection of elements that are of the same type or
        have similar meaning. 
        Lists are preferable when only value is nedded not to associate value with keys
        It is preferable when it is nedded to store duplicate values of elements because lists
        contains duplicate value also.
        It is preferable when it is nedded to process elements seqentially.
