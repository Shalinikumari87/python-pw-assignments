question:  Explain why strings are immutable in Python?
Answer:  Strings are immutable because we cannot change the elements after string creation.
        We cannot do modification in strings means that we cannot add or remove or change 
        elements. Here are some reasons why strings are immutable

        1.  Python can safely reuse the same memory location for identical strings instead of 
            creating new objects every time the string is used. This happens due to its immutability.

        2.  Since strings are immutable, the memory allocated for a string can be safely shared
            between variables, functions, or parts of the program, without the risk of one part of 
            the program accidentally modifying it. This makes Python's memory management more efficient. 

        3. In multi-threaded programs, immutability provides thread safety. Since strings cannot
           be modified, there is no risk of data corruption when multiple threads access the same 
           string object simultaneously.
