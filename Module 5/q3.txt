question: What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?
Answer: The main difference betwwen lists and tuples are as follows:

        1. Lists are mutable whwereas tuples are immutable that means in lists we can 
           modify elements such as adding and removing elements from a lists.
           But in tuples we cannot modify elements we cannot add or remove elements from
           a tuple.

        2. Lists is denoted by big brackets[], whereas tuples are denoted by small brackets()
        3. Lists occupies more space in computer memory whereas tuples occupies less memory
           space.
        4.Lists are slower than tuples beacause of their mutablity whwereas tuples are faster
          than lists due to its immutable characterstic.

        5. In lists we can do many methods for modifying lists. we can add, remove,append elements
           iside the lists whereas in tuple we cannot use modifucation but only few mthods we can
           apply to tuple such as count and index.
