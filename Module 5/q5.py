question: Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?
Answer:
        Sets and lists both stores data. But set automatically removes duplicates from the set
        means that if we want to add any duplicate value it will ignore the duplivate value
        whereas list can store muliple value at a time.

        sets provides membership test means that if particular element is there in sets or not
        It will give output in bool value
        But in list we have to arrange the elements sequentially then membership test will be 
        possible.
        
        Sets supports mathematical operations such as union, intersection, difference and symetric
        difference.
        But in list we cannot do such type of operations.
        That's why we use set instead of list.
