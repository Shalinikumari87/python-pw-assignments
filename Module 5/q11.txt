question: What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?
Answer: Dictionaries in Python offer several advantages over lists for certain tasks, 
        especially when we need to store and retrieve data efficiently based on unique keys.

        Here are the advantages of using dictionary over lists:
        1.  Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs. This makes them ideal when you need to
            associate unique keys with specific values.
            whereas in list store data as an ordered sequence of elements without any association
            to a unique key. To access a value index is nedded.

        2.  In dictionaries, each key is unique. If we try to add a new key-value pair with an existing
            key, it will overwrite the old value associated with that key.
            whereas in list  duplicates are allowed, and each element is indexed by position, which
            could lead to confusion if we need to retrieve specific data based on content rather than position.

        3.  Dictionaries provide fast updating, insertion, and deletion of key-value pairs.
            whereas in lists adding, updating, or deleting elements (especially in the middle of the list)
            can be less efficient
