question: Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?
Answer: Dictionary are unordered because they do not maintain the order in which key-value pairs
        are inserted.

        It affects on data retrieval in this way:

        In dictionary key value are returned in unordered way not seqentially this means when
        we want a particlar key value in sequence we cannot get that.

        Dictionaries don't maintain insertion order, we cannot find the position of elements 
        when iterating through the dictionary. The order of elements in the dictionary can change
        with various operations (like deletions or insertions).
