question: What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?
Answer:
        String is a seqence of character and it is used to represent text based data.
        It is written in single quotes or double quotes.
        
        strings is a sequence of character but list is collection of objects. It can 
        store any data type.
        strings are immutable whereas lists are mutable.
        In strings we can perform limited operations such as conceation, slicing and formating.
        but in  lists we can perform various operation such as apeend, remove or change elements

        Strings have methods specific to string manipulation, such as .lower(), .upper(), .replace(), .split(), .join(), etc.
        Lists have methods like append, remove, pop, sort, reverse, and more
        String acess character by index whereas list acess elements by index.
        Strings is basically used for storing and manipulating text data
        whereas lists are more versatile than strings and stores all type of data.
