question: How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?
Answer: Tuples are immutable data type that means it cannot be changed after its creation.
        Tuples helps to ensure data integrity in many ways are as:

        1. The main feature of a tuple is that it is immutable
           Once a tuple is created, its values cannot be changed
           added to, or removed. This prevents accidental modifications to the data.

        2. This immutability ensures that data within a tuple cannot be modified,
           which is particularly useful for maintaining integrity in critical data.
           For example, when passing data to functions or across different parts of
           a program, we can be confident that the data will not be altered.

        3. Tuples are often used to pass around data between functions or threads because
           they guarantee that the data won't be inadvertently changed. This is important when
           we need to ensure that the data remains consistent across different parts of the 
           program.
