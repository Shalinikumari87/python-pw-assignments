question: Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.
Answer:  Lists are ordered collection of elements and by the elemets indexes we can get data
         means elements.
         Dictionaries are unordered collection of key value and by its key we can get data
         not by the indexes.
         In list we can get data by elements positions in the list using starting index that it
         0.
         In dictionaries we get data by acessing the key that is present in dictionary.
         In list accessing elements don't take too much time because by the index we can get 
         elements in limited time.
         But in dictionary all the time we have to give a key to return the value that is present 
         in dictionary it takes more time than lists.
